# ðŸ§  Langchain-x-Langgraph

Hello! This repo is my playground for experimenting with cool concepts in LangChain and LangGraph.  
Iâ€™ve been exploring and building small projects to understand how these tools work and what they can do.

## Whatâ€™s the deal with this repo?

I built this to learn by doing â€” testing out ideas, building proof-of-concepts, and figuring out what works best.  
Each folder has a quick explanation, why itâ€™s cool, and some code you can play with.

## How to use this?

- Clone it  
- Pick a folder that sounds interesting  
- Dive into the README inside that folder for details and code  
- Try running stuff, tweak it, have fun!
